# ToDo Backend

_RESTful API - Task Management System_

## Objective ‚å®Ô∏è

A REST API for a task management system must be created. Through this system a user will be able to view, add, edit or delete his personal tasks. Each task must have an associated status, which can be "pending", "in progress" or "completed". In addition, the paths to access the tasks must be protected, and only authenticated users should be able to access them.

## Beginning üöÄ

### Database diagram üíæ

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ TASK : have
    USER ||--o{ HISTORY_USER_TASK : have
    USER {
        UUID id PK "DEFAULT UUID_GENERATE_V4"
        VARCHAR name "NOT NULL"
        VARCHAR last_name "NOT NULL"
        VARCHAR email UK "NOT NULL"
        VARCHAR password "NOT NULL"
        TIMESTAMP created_at "DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    }

    TASK ||--o{ HISTORY_USER_TASK : have
    TASK {
        UUID id PK "DEFAULT UUID_GENERATE_V4"
        VARCHAR user_id FK "NOT NULL"
        VARCHAR title "NOT NULL"
        VARCHAR description "NOT NULL"
        VARCHAR comment
        TEXT tags
        VARCHAR file
        TaskStatusEnum status "NOT NULL"
        TIMESTAMP created_at "DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
        TIMESTAMP updated_at "DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    }

    HISTORY_USER_TASK {
        VARCHAR id PK "DEFAULT UUID_GENERATE_V4"
        VARCHAR user_id FK "NOT NULL"
        VARCHAR task_id FK "NOT NULL"
        TaskActionEnum action
        TIMESTAMP updated_at "DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    }
```

### Prerequisites üìã
It is necessary to mention that the service needs [environment](.env.example) variables which are very necessary for the operation of the service.

For the database, we chose to use a local database by means of [docker compose](docker-compose.yml)

To lift the containers simply use the following command in the root folder

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

### Installation üîß
To install the dependencies of the service simply use the following command
```shell
npm install
```

### Running üÜô
Depending on the environment, it is recommended to initialize the project.

- Dev
    ```shell
    npm run start:dev
    ```
- Prod
    ```shell
    npm run start:prod
    ```
## Documentation üìÑ
- Swagger
  In code it was decided to document with swagger, the path of the documentation is as follows
  ```route
  http://localhost:3000/docs
  ```


- Postman
  Since the endpoints can send files and various complex parameters, it was also decided to make a documentation in Postman, in order to make the requests more easily.
  [Here](https://www.postman.com/BetoNajera9/workspace/todo) is the link to the collection
